# Personal Productivity Dashboard

Project **Group 3: Korotkevich Guild** as part of JavaScript week.
This dashboard was created with the aim of learning key concepts such as variables, buttons, conditionals, functions, repetitive structures, DOM manipulation, and JavaScript data structures, applied to a single web page.



## Overview

The interface consists of **6 buttons**, each with a specific functionality, developed by a team member. The design is minimalist and functional, using **HTML**, **basic CSS**, and **pure JavaScript**, without external libraries.

##  Features


* Andrés Restrepo
Task counter button
Increases a counter each time it is pressed.
It also displays custom messages as warnings when 3 and 5 clicks are reached.
It uses a global variable, if, and dynamic DOM modification.

Button to display days of the week
When clicked, it dynamically generates a list of the days of the week.
It uses an array and a for loop to create and display each day as an li element in the DOM.


* Juan David González
Button to add tasks
Validates whether the user wrote something in the text field:
If it is empty: displays a warning message.
If it has content: confirms that the task was added correctly.
Then adds it to the list of tasks to do for the week.
Uses trim(), truthy/falsy conditions, and CSS classes for the message style.

* Roxana Naranjo
Displays a random productivity tip when clicked.
Uses an array of tips and selects one at random with Math.random() and Math.floor().
Manipulates the content of a paragraph on screen.

* Cristian Henao P
Conditional greeting button
This button displays a different message depending on the time of day.
It uses a function, a conditional structure (if/else), and DOM manipulation to display greetings such as “Good morning,” “Good afternoon,” or “Good evening.”


* Juan Pablo Vargas
Background color change button
Allows you to change the background color with each click.
A color is randomly selected from a predefined array using conditionals and style manipulation with JavaScript.
